# Contributing to Zerobase
We're so happy to have you! Where governments are unable or unwilling to adequately test people for CoV-SARS-2, we're here to bridge the
gap by enabling even resource-poor communities to utilize advanced tracing techniques to contain infections. An investment of a few hours
of your time to our cause could be directly responsible for eliminating days or weeks of unnecessary human suffering. So let's get to it!

## What Do I Have To Commit To?
Nothing, unless you want to. While there are positions and resposibilities that will require a consistent commitment of a few hours a day,
we also have plenty of use for those who can only donate an hour or two of their time per week. We understand that your life is busy, and
will do everything possible to respect that. If you are interested in taking up a more active leadership role and have the time to
do so, please reach out to Aron for further instructions (and thank you!).

## Who Do We Need?
Whether it's technical expertise, organization, leadership or just your time, any and all things you can contribute will tangibly benefit
Zerobase. While developers are likely to be the largest category of contributors in terms of numbers, we need folks of all disciplines and
walks of life to make this happen. We are in *particular* need of your help if you fall into the categories listed below but this list 
is not exhaustive; we need all kinds of people forall kinds of tasks.
If you can't find a niche that feels right, please reach out on [Slack](https://necsi-edu.slack.com/archives/CV57RBU8H). 

### Software Industry Professionals, Students and Hobbyists
#### Professionals
// Straight to the chase, GitHub links and any niches for which we have a particular need
// Quick two-sentence description of each subsystem, its tech stack and what it needs
// I don't think we need to sell these people, they know what to do and are almost certainly interested if they're in CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Students and Hobbyists
Is your proficiency closer to a "Hello, World!" or beginner level? No worries, your time and attention can still make a big impact.
There's tasks in this project that don't require deep understandings of the languages and platforms in use, such as bolstering
documentation and writing unit tests. But this isn't just a one-way relationship, there's a huge amount for you to gain personally from
working with us. In addition to the invaluable experience gained from working on real, production systems, you'll be immediately connected
with a large network of highly knowledgable and experienced professionals who you can learn from. If you're wondering if this is a good way
to learn about software and programming, ask anyone in this industry if they'd prefer hire someone with a year of Comp Sci learning 
at a university or someone who's worked on a production system for a few months. Nine times out of ten, they'll take the latter.

Here's where you can get started:
// Can we get a list of beginner-friendly tasks for this section? I'm thinking of the huge number of students who are currently not
// in school, and see them as a major potential source of development effort. Lots of opportunity there

### Medical Professionals
// No idea what to put here, I know we need these people though

### Outreach and Activism
You don't need to be an expert in anything to become a part of our cause to end CoV-SARS-2, your voice alone is a powerful contribution.
// Deferring to someone else for the rest of this.
