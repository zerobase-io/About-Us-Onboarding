# Deployments Team

## Our Mission
Our mission is to oversee and run on the ground deployments to businesses, communities, testing facilities, and public health officials. 

## Roadmap
We are wrapping up our first deployments push to Manchester, and gearing up for our next push. This means improving our materials, CRM, and call scripts.
