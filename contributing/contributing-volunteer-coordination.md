# Volunteer Coordination Team

## Our Mission
Our mission on volunteer coordination team is to inspire volunteers to contribute their highest selves to humanity by creating the opportunities for them to join a team and focus the best of who they are into creating something that matters to everyone for everyone.

## Roadmap
Our current goal is to streamline the process of volunteer onboarding to prepare zerobase to grow from 150 volunteers to 1,500 and beyond.

## Onboarding
* Ask @eriksogn on our Slack to join our volunteer coordination team.
* Ask @eriksogn for access to our private [#zerobase-volunteer-coordination](https://necsi-edu.slack.com/archives/G0104HE1JP4) channel.
* Join our [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tbl7FW1yukl3kBvRP/viw5k8lpO4iJ4T2iJ) for our volunteer list
* Join our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/0iffx6o6/volunteer-coordination) for tasks to improve volunteer coordination

## Contributing

### Onboarding new users
* Watch for new registrations from our volunteer registration form on Slack
* Check our Airtable https://airtable.com/tbl7FW1yukl3kBvRP/viw50oMnktUK5ylaE?blocks=hide and see if that new volunteer is in progress
* Reach out and find the new user on slack. Introduce yourself and welcome them to zerobase.
* Update their record when you have connected with them on slack, when they have joined a team, and watch for and celebrate their first contribution.
