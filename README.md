# Zerobase
Zerobase is a smart, anonymous tracing technology that identifies and notifies individuals in our communities who have been exposed to 
COVID-19, even before they exhibit symptoms. Zerobase is simple, free, and ready to use.

## Contact Tracing
Tracing is the identification of likely disease-spreading interaction between individuals. It is a crucial part of modern pandemic 
response.

If an individual is exposed to COVID-19, tracing allows us to identify any number of others who were in the same place, such as a 
grocery store, pharmacy, place of worship, or doctor’s office, at the same time as the infected person. Public health officials can then 
notify those people to stay home temporarily and/or get tested themselves, thus slowing the spread of the virus.

To contain COVID-19, communities must engage in both effective tracing and testing measures. However, while testing is currently limited 
and we await the mass-manufacture of test kits, we can best prepare by using a tracing system in our communities as soon as possible. 
Tracing maximizes the value of every single test by helping identify the hundreds of untested members of a community that are at risk of 
infection based on their proximity to an infected individual.

## How Does Zerobase Work?

We have developed a simple and effective tracing solution that is ready to be used in any community. Here’s how it works:

1. Paper printouts with unique Zerobase QR codes are posted at the entrances of high-risk touchpoints like grocery stores, restaurants,  
pharmacies, doctor's offices, and places of worship.
2. People entering a participating location scan the code (for most people, this is as simple as pointing their phone’s camera at the 
sign - it takes just a few seconds, and no app installation required). 
3. Zerobase’s tracing technology anonymously analyzes community networks of interaction to identify people who visited the same place at 
roughly the same time. 
4. If an individual tests positive for COVID-19, public health officials can use Zerobase to direct anyone who has been in their 
presence to self-quarantine and/or get tested.


## How Do I Use Zerobase?
Zerobase is designed to be as easy as possible for new users to integrate into their routines, and requires very little training and
almost zero technical know-how. The user needs only to do three things:

1. Register themselves with Zerobase simply by visiting [our website](https://zerobase.io) on a mobile device (first use only)
2. Scan Zerobase QR codes whenever they encounter them (takes under two seconds!)
3. Occassionally, check back at [our website](https://zerobase.io) for any new notifications. Additionally, users can subscribe to one
of our direct messaging systems (SMS, email, push notifications), but this is not required!

That's it! Zerobase is fast and easy to use by design. With practice, pulling out your phone and scanning a QR code can be done in under
two seconds, requiring very minimal disruption to the user's day.

## How Is Zerobase Implemented?
If you're curious how Zerobase works and want to learn more, see [our privacy statement](./PRIVACY.md) for the specifics of how we 
provide this service with an unrivaled promise of privacy. Additionally, we're 100% open-source, so if you want to see how something 
works or how your data is handled, you can view our source code directly.
